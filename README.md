# EHR-System

## “Electronic Health Record system of patient medical history, for a faster and better healthcare service”

## Problem Statement :
Health data is more than just statistics or numbers. It can be collected, used, and shared in lots of different ways. But ignoring specific medical data can change the way you are going to treat, how your care is provided and what happens to you as a result.

It is imperative to maintain efficient software to handle the information of a Patient. This application provides a way to record this information and to access these in a simple way.

## Aim :
We are aiming to build an electronic healthcare record system to keep a track of patient's records that will ease the process of storing and retrieval of information of a particular patient and prevent waste of time in case of emergency.The system would also provide excellent security of data at every level of user-system interaction and also provide robust & reliable storage and backup facilities. Our main objective is to lower the loss of medical records, make hospitals paperless so as to save trees and which in turn would diminish the need for double testing. Now as the records would be stored in a common database, it would thus reduce the time taken for diagnosis and treatment and lessen the time taken to communicate between departments. Our database would also make it easier for the doctor and the patients to check onto their own history of diseases, treatments, lab reports and prescriptions. This would help both the patient to make informed choices during their treatment based on their history and for the doctor to prescribe based on the patient's history. Our database would also make it easier for statistical analysis of a country's health situation as it would share the data with the administration. This would also help as it would make it easier to contact the administration of another hospital about the details of some patients which would make it easier to refer patients. Our system would also make it easier for the visitors to get the details of their respective patients and would show them what all timings are there for them to meet their loved ones. Last but not the least our database would make it easier to buy the prescribed medicine as that information could be shared with the pharmaceuticals. This would be helpful because it will Increase readability/legibility, hence reduce medical errors and handwritten prescribed errors and also would eliminate prescription forging.

## Special Facility : 
* EHRs can also trigger warnings and reminders when a patient should get a new lab test or track prescriptions to see if a patient has been following doctors' orders.

* Use of computer vision in uploading and scanning the patient reports and get some input for further use.

* We would also keep a record of DGHS/CGHS and the patient's medical insurance facility to help patients manage their health better.
